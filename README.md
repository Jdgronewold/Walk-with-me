## Walk with Me (Development)

### Background

As a woman, being alone in the middle of the night can be an uncomfortable situation, no matter the neighborhood theyâ€™re in. Walk with Me is a mobile iOS application built with React Native that uses GPS to locate other woman around to walk home with.

The app will feature a rating system for users to rate each other, keeping the experience for both users enjoyable each time. There will also be a strikes feature that will be used to ban users from using the application if they are reported as male or unpleasant to walk with.
